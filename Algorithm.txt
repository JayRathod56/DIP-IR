clear all input and output from the console
create a 3x3 matrix and assign it to var x
then create a 2x3 matrix and assign it to var h
use conv2() function to get 2D Linear convolution of x and h

clear all input and output from the console
Take input from user for x and h variable
convert x and h to (discrete) fast fourier transformation and assign to var X and H
multiply X and H and assign it to var Y
convert Y to inverse (discrete) fast fourier transform
display the Circular Convolution Results i.e Y

clear all input and output from the console
create two 2x2 matrix and assign it to var x and h
use function conv2 to get a 2d convolution of x and h and store it in y
add column 1 and 3 of y and assign it to var y1 with col 2 of y
then add row 1 and 3 of y1 and assign it to var y2 with row 2 of y1
display linear convolution result i.e y
and display circular convolution expressed as linear convolution i.e y2
